                        <p class="mb-20">At Rose Jade Inc., we understand that managing cash flow is
                            vital to running a successful business. Whether you're facing seasonal
                            fluctuations, unexpected expenses, or looking to seize new
                            opportunities, our Line of Credit solutions offer the flexibility and
                            financial security
                            you need. With a revolving line of credit, you only borrow what you need
                            and repay it on your terms, ensuring you have access to funds whenever
                            your business requires them.
                            We provide tailored credit options that give you the freedom to manage
                            your working capital effectively while maintaining financial stability
                            and fueling growth.</p>

                        <p class="mb-20">A business line of credit gives you the flexibility to
                            access funds at any time, without needing to apply for a loan each time.
                            It provides you with a revolving credit limit, meaning you can borrow,
                            repay, and borrow again as needed. This makes it an excellent option for
                            businesses that need flexible, short-term funding for various purposes,
                            including inventory purchases, emergency expenses, and business
                            expansion.</p>

                                            Repayments are typically made monthly, and as you repay, the amount you’ve

                                            repayments based on sales. If business revenue dips, it can strain cash flow
                                            and lead to financial stress. Additionally, the short repayment term can
                                            create a cycle of debt if not managed properly.
